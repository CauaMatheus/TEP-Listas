### First, analyze the problem:
![radius](/geometria/03/assets/j.png)

We already have the chord length, and the arch length

Now, we only have two variables left to find (radius and alpha).
But this two variables is proportional to the other, so finding one will cause
to find the other.

I've tried to binary search the alpha, but i got TLE.
Trying to binary search the radius it worked perfectly fine.

### So mow, binary search the radius and we can find all the others variables
